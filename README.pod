=head1 DESCRIPTION

This documentation covers the API for SQL::Transpose.  For a more general
discussion of how to use the modules and scripts, please see
L<SQL::Transpose::Manual>.

SQL::Transpose is a group of Perl modules that converts
vendor-specific SQL table definitions into other formats, such as
other vendor-specific SQL, ER diagrams, documentation (POD and HTML),
XML, and Class::DBI classes.  The main focus of SQL::Transpose is
SQL, but parsers exist for other structured data formats, including
Excel spreadsheets and arbitrarily delimited text files.  Through the
separation of the code into parsers and producers with an object model
in between, it's possible to combine any parser with any producer, to
plug in custom parsers or producers, or to manipulate the parsed data
via the built-in object model.  Presently only the definition parts of
SQL are handled (CREATE, ALTER), not the manipulation of data (INSERT,
UPDATE, DELETE).

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

=head2 new

The constructor is called C<new>, and accepts a optional hash of options.
Valid options are:

=over 4

=item *

parser / from

=item *

parser_args

=item *

producer / to

=item *

producer_args

=item *

filters

=item *

filename / file

=item *

data

=item *

debug

=item *

add_drop_table

=item *

quote_identifiers

=item *

quote_table_names (DEPRECATED)

=item *

quote_field_names (DEPRECATED)

=item *

no_comments

=item *

trace

=item *

validate

=back

All options are, well, optional; these attributes can be set via
instance methods.  Internally, they are; no (non-syntactical)
advantage is gained by passing options to the constructor.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 add_drop_table

Toggles whether or not to add "DROP TABLE" statements just before the
create definitions.

=head2 quote_identifiers

Toggles whether or not to quote identifiers (table, column, constraint, etc.)
with a quoting mechanism suitable for the chosen Producer. The default (true)
is to quote them.

=head2 quote_table_names

DEPRECATED - A legacy proxy to L</quote_identifiers>

=head2 quote_field_names

DEPRECATED - A legacy proxy to L</quote_identifiers>

=head2 no_comments

Toggles whether to print comments in the output.  Accepts a true or false
value, returns the current value.

=head2 producer

The C<producer> method is an accessor/mutator, used to retrieve or
define what subroutine is called to produce the output.  A subroutine
defined as a producer will be invoked as a function (I<not a method>)
and passed its container C<SQL::Transpose> instance, which it should
call the C<schema> method on, to get the C<SQL::Transpose::Schema>
generated by the parser.  It is expected that the function transform the
schema structure to a string.  The C<SQL::Transpose> instance is also useful
for informational purposes; for example, the type of the parser can be
retrieved using the C<parser_type> method, and the C<error> and
C<debug> methods can be called when needed.

When defining a producer, one of several things can be passed in:  A
module name (e.g., C<My::Groovy::Producer>), a module name relative to
the C<SQL::Transpose::Producer> namespace (e.g., C<MySQL>), a module
name and function combination (C<My::Groovy::Producer::transmogrify>),
or a reference to an anonymous subroutine.  If a full module name is
passed in (for the purposes of this method, a string containing "::"
is considered to be a module name), it is treated as a package, and a
function called "produce" will be invoked: C<$modulename::produce>.
If $modulename cannot be loaded, the final portion is stripped off and
treated as a function.  In other words, if there is no file named
F<My/Groovy/Producer/transmogrify.pm>, C<SQL::Transpose> will attempt
to load F<My/Groovy/Producer.pm> and use C<transmogrify> as the name of
the function, instead of the default C<produce>.

  my $tr = SQL::Transpose->new;

  # This will invoke My::Groovy::Producer::produce($tr, $data)
  $tr->producer("My::Groovy::Producer");

  # This will invoke SQL::Transpose::Producer::Sybase::produce($tr, $data)
  $tr->producer("Sybase");

  # This will invoke My::Groovy::Producer::transmogrify($tr, $data),
  # assuming that My::Groovy::Producer::transmogrify is not a module
  # on disk.
  $tr->producer("My::Groovy::Producer::transmogrify");

  # This will invoke the referenced subroutine directly, as
  # $subref->($tr, $data);
  $tr->producer(\&my_producer);

There is also a method named C<producer_type>, which is a string
containing the classname to which the above C<produce> function
belongs.  In the case of anonymous subroutines, this method returns
the string "CODE".

Finally, there is a method named C<producer_args>, which is both an
accessor and a mutator.  Arbitrary data may be stored in name => value
pairs for the producer subroutine to access:

  sub My::Random::producer {
      my ($tr, $data) = @_;
      my $pr_args = $tr->producer_args();

      # $pr_args is a hashref.

Extra data passed to the C<producer> method is passed to
C<producer_args>:

  $tr->producer("xSV", delimiter => ',\s*');

  # In SQL::Transpose::Producer::xSV:
  my $args = $tr->producer_args;
  my $delimiter = $args->{'delimiter'}; # value is ,\s*

=head2 parser

The C<parser> method defines or retrieves a subroutine that will be
called to perform the parsing.  The basic idea is the same as that of
C<producer> (see above), except the default subroutine name is
"parse", and will be invoked as C<$module_name::parse($tr, $data)>.
Also, the parser subroutine will be passed a string containing the
entirety of the data to be parsed.

  # Invokes SQL::Transpose::Parser::MySQL::parse()
  $tr->parser("MySQL");

  # Invokes My::Groovy::Parser::parse()
  $tr->parser("My::Groovy::Parser");

  # Invoke an anonymous subroutine directly
  $tr->parser(sub {
    my $dumper = Data::Dumper->new([ $_[1] ], [ "SQL" ]);
    $dumper->Purity(1)->Terse(1)->Deepcopy(1);
    return $dumper->Dump;
  });

There is also C<parser_type> and C<parser_args>, which perform
analogously to C<producer_type> and C<producer_args>

=head2 filters

Set or retrieve the filters to run over the schema during the
translation, before the producer creates its output. Filters are sub
routines called, in order, with the schema object to filter as the 1st
arg and a hash of options (passed as a list) for the rest of the args.
They are free to do whatever they want to the schema object, which will be
handed to any following filters, then used by the producer.

Filters are set as an array, which gives the order they run in.
Like parsers and producers, they can be defined by a module name, a
module name relative to the SQL::Transpose::Filter namespace, a module
name and function name together or a reference to an anonymous subroutine.
When using a module name a function called C<filter> will be invoked in
that package to do the work.

To pass args to the filter set it as an array ref with the 1st value giving
the filter (name or sub) and the rest its args. e.g.

 $tr->filters(
     sub {
        my $schema = shift;
        # Do stuff to schema here!
     },
     DropFKeys,
     [ "Names", table => 'lc' ],
     [ "Foo",   foo => "bar", hello => "world" ],
     [ "Filter5" ],
 );

Although you normally set them in the constructor, which calls
through to filters. i.e.

  my $translator  = SQL::Transpose->new(
      ...
      filters => [
          sub { ... },
          [ "Names", table => 'lc' ],
      ],
      ...
  );

See F<t/36-filters.t> for more examples.

Multiple set calls to filters are cumulative with new filters added to
the end of the current list.

Returns the filters as a list of array refs, the 1st value being a
reference to the filter sub and the rest its args.

=head2 show_warnings

Toggles whether to print warnings of name conflicts, identifier
mutations, etc.  Probably only generated by producers to let the user
know when something won't translate very smoothly (e.g., MySQL "enum"
fields into Oracle).  Accepts a true or false value, returns the
current value.

=head2 translate

The C<translate> method calls the subroutine referenced by the
C<parser> data member, then calls any C<filters> and finally calls
the C<producer> sub routine (these members are described above).
It accepts as arguments a number of things, in key => value format,
including (potentially) a parser and a producer (they are passed
directly to the C<parser> and C<producer> methods).

Here is how the parameter list to C<translate> is parsed:

=over

=item *

1 argument means it's the data to be parsed; which could be a string
(filename) or a reference to a scalar (a string stored in memory), or a
reference to a hash, which is parsed as being more than one argument
(see next section).

  # Parse the file /path/to/datafile
  my $output = $tr->translate("/path/to/datafile");

  # Parse the data contained in the string $data
  my $output = $tr->translate(\$data);

=item *

More than 1 argument means its a hash of things, and it might be
setting a parser, producer, or datasource (this key is named
"filename" or "file" if it's a file, or "data" for a SCALAR reference.

  # As above, parse /path/to/datafile, but with different producers
  foreach my $prod ("MySQL", "XML", "Sybase") {
      print $tr->translate(
                producer => $prod,
                filename => "/path/to/datafile",
            );
  }

  # The filename hash key could also be:
      datasource => \$data,

You get the idea.

=back

=head2 filename, data

Using the C<filename> method, the filename of the data to be parsed
can be set. This method can be used in conjunction with the C<data>
method, below.  If both the C<filename> and C<data> methods are
invoked as mutators, the data set in the C<data> method is used.

    $tr->filename("/my/data/files/create.sql");

or:

    my $create_script = do {
        local $/;
        open CREATE, "/my/data/files/create.sql" or die $!;
        <CREATE>;
    };
    $tr->data(\$create_script);

C<filename> takes a string, which is interpreted as a filename.
C<data> takes a reference to a string, which is used as the data to be
parsed.  If a filename is set, then that file is opened and read when
the C<translate> method is called, as long as the data instance
variable is not set.

=head2 schema

Returns the SQL::Transpose::Schema object.

=head2 trace

Turns on/off the tracing option of Parse::RecDescent.

=head2 validate

Whether or not to validate the schema object after parsing and before
producing.

=head2 version

Returns the version of the SQL::Transpose release.
